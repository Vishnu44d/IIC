Ministry of HRD has established ‘MHRD’s Innovation Cell’ with the mandate to work closely with our Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to encourage the creative energy of our student population to work on new ideas and innovation and promote them to create start-ups and entrepreneurial ventures.

Innovation Cell will focus on creating complete ecosystem which will foster the culture of Innovation across all educational institutions from ideas generation to pre-incubation, incubation and graduating from the incubator as successful start-ups. The primary mandate of MIC is to encourage, inspire and nurture young students by supporting them to work with new ideas while they are in formative years. MIC has envisioned creation of ‘Institution’s Innovation Council (IICs)’ across selected HEIs. A network of these IICs will be established to promote innovation in the Institution through multitudinous modes leading to an innovation promotion eco-system in these campuses.

Major Focus of IIC:
    1.  To create a vibrant local innovation ecosystem
    2.  Start-up/ entrepreneurship supporting Mechanism in HEIs
    3.  Prepare institute for Atal Ranking of Institutions on Innovation Achievements Framework (ARIIA)
    4.  Establish Function Ecosystem for Scouting Ideas and Pre-incubation of Ideas
    5.  Develop better Cognitive Ability amongst Technology Students
